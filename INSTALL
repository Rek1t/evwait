Manual compilation (if autotools are not available):
$> gcc -o evwait evwait.c

Otherwise, run the following commands.

$> autoreconf -iv
$> configure --prefix=/usr 
$> make 
$> make install

Adjust the prefix as necessary, on most distributions /usr is fine.
evwait itself has no requirements other than the C compiler.
